# Shorelark: Rust + Web Assembly + Neural Netowrks + Genetic Algorithm

In this project I wrote a Neural Network & Genetic Algorithm from scratch with the help of a tutorial and later used those two to teach train birds (more like triangles) to learn to find food (more like circles) on their own. Open console to see results after each training step.
